Task 3 : Cat commands


    1. Create 3 files namely umuzi.md, recruits.md and cohort.md. 

// Answers as from the Terminal
/*

recruit@umuzi-admin:~/workspace$ touch umuzi.md recruits.md cohort.md

*/

    2. Fill all 3 files with contents of your choice. Maybe some nice poems about you MUB experience.

/*
recruit@umuzi-admin:~/workspace$ echo 'hi' > umuzi.md


recruit@umuzi-admin:~/workspace$ echo 'this was' > recruits.md


recruit@umuzi-admin:~/workspace$ echo 'fun and interesting' > cohort.md


*/

    3. Write a script that concatenates the content of umuzi.md, recruit.md, cohort.md and displays the result on the screen.

/*

recruit@umuzi-admin:~/workspace$ cat umuzi.md recruits.md cohort.md
hi
this was
fun and interesting

*/

    4. Write a script that takes the content of umuzi.md, cohort.md and recruits.md to print/store the output into a new file named summary.md.

/*

recruit@umuzi-admin:~/workspace$ cat umuzi.md recruits.md cohort.md >> summary.md

*/

   5. use the command line to append the words “The End” to summary.md. Be careful not to overwrite the exiting contend

/*

recruit@umuzi-admin:~/workspace$ echo "The End" >> summary.md
recruit@umuzi-admin:~/workspace$ cat summary.md
hi
this was
fun and interesting
The End

*/
